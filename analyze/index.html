    <p> to plan a website you must first find out the purpose of the website.
      then you need to figure out your target audience. then figure out what
      kind of display your website will be running on. next you create mockups
       of a website such as a wireframe and sitemap. then you pick the graphics
       colors and typography that best suit your needs. then you need to make
       sure it is up to accesability standards. and finally you need to plan out
        a timeline and budjet for the project to present</p>
